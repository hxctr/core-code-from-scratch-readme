7. Bake for at least 15 minutes.
8. Take our pizza out of the oven.


### 2. Hot N Cold 🤒 🧊 🔥
**Steps**
1. Ask the user if he wants to convert Celsius or Fahrenheit and respective temperature.
2. If the user selects celsius, then use the next formula to convert to fahrenheit: F = (C*9/5).<br>
    2.1. Show the final temperature in F units.
3. If the user selects Fahrenheit, then convert it to celsius by using the next formula: C = (F-32)*5/9.<br>
    3.1. Show the final temperature in C units.

### 3. Geometry 📐

1. Ask the user the shape he wants to calculate the volume.
2. If the shape is "pyramid", do<br>
2.1 Ask for the length, width, and height of the pyramid.<br>
2.2 Use and replace values in the next formula: V = (length * width * height) / 3.<br>
2.3 Show the volume of the pyramid.
3. If the shape is "cube", do <br>
3.1 Ask for the length.<br>
3.2 Use and replace values in the next formula: V = length * length * length.<br>
3.3 Show the volume of cube.
4. If the shape is "sphere", do<br>
4.1 Ask the user for the radius.<br>
4.2 Use and replace in the next formula: V = (4/3) * pi * r^3.<br>
4.3 Show the volume of the sphere

## Week challenges (Thursday)
### 1. Numbers 📊
1. Ask the user to enter a number.
2. Check if the number es divided by 2.
3. If the number is divided by 2, then show in console "Number is even".
4. If not, then show the next message "Number is odd"

### 2. Date of birth 👧
1. Ask the user to enter their date of birth with the next way DD-MM-YYYY.
2. Separate by day, month, and year.
3. Start to calculate the current date.
4. Substract the user's birth year from the current year.
5. Show the person's age.

### 3. Treasures 👑
Chest A -> This chest has a treasure -> false.<br>
Chest B -> All the chests have treasures -> true.<br>
Chest C -> Just one of these chests has a treasure -> false.

Answer: chest A and chest C have the treasure.

# Pseudocode - Week 2
## Week challenges (Monday)
### 1. Logic problem
1. If Alice is telling the truth, then nobody studied math.
2. If bob is telling the truth, it means that just one person studied math yesterday.
3. If Charlie is saying the truth, then exactly two people studied math yesterday.
4. If Dan is telling the truth, then exactly three people studied math yesterday.
5. If Eva is telling the truth, then exactly for people studied math yesterday.

Therefore, only Bob is telling the truth and just one person studied math yesterday.

### 2. Cereal vrs Milk
1. Get a bowl.
2. Pour the milk into the bowl.
3. Add some sugar.
4. Pour cereal into the bowl.
5. Enjoy.
